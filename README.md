## Project Structure
This project consists of four main components:
- **/end-user-api**: Backend API for end-users
- **/end-user-ui**: Frontend application for end-users
- **/mgmt-api**: Backend API for management/administration
- **/mgmt-ui**: Frontend application for management/administration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB
- Elasticsearch (for knowledge base functionality)
- Redis (optional, for enhanced real-time functionality)
- GEMINI API KEY (obtain from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/chungnn/ai-chat365.git
    cd ai-chat365
    ```

2. Set up the end-user API:
    ```powershell
    cd end-user-api
    npm install
    # Generate RSA key pair for JWT authentication
    node generate-keys.js
    # Configure your .env file based on the example
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Set up the end-user UI (in a new terminal):
    ```powershell
    cd end-user-ui
    npm install
    npm run serve
    ```

4. Set up the management API (in a new terminal):
    ```powershell
    cd mgmt-api
    npm install
    # Configure your .env file based on the example
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Set up the management UI (in a new terminal):
    ```powershell
    cd mgmt-ui
    npm install
    npm run serve
    ```
